# ⚡ Build Tools for Spring Boot Microservices  

Build tools help automate the **compilation, testing, packaging, and dependency management** process in projects.  
They make development faster, standardized, and more maintainable.

## 📦 Apache Maven [➡️ Learn More](Maven/Maven_Guide_README.md)  

Maven is one of the most widely used build tools in the Java ecosystem. It is especially popular for **Spring Boot and Microservices projects**.  

### 🔑 Key Features  
- 📂 Uses **`pom.xml`** for configuration and dependency management.  
- ⚡ Supports **lifecycle phases** (compile → test → package → deploy).  
- 📦 Provides **centralized repository** for libraries.  
- 🔄 Follows **Convention over Configuration** (less boilerplate).  
- 🌍 Large community and industry-standard in Java projects.  

👉 Maven is best suited when you need a **standard, easy-to-use, and reliable build tool** for enterprise projects.

## 🚀 Gradle  

Gradle is a **modern, fast, and flexible** build tool that is widely used for **Java, Spring Boot, and Android projects**.  

### 🔑 Key Features  
- ⚡ **Performance Boost** with incremental builds and caching.  
- ✍️ Uses **Groovy or Kotlin DSL** for configuration (more flexible than XML).  
- 📦 Supports **multi-module projects** efficiently.  
- 🔗 Can reuse **Maven and Ivy repositories**.  
- 🔄 Highly customizable for complex enterprise systems.  

👉 Gradle is best when you need **speed, flexibility, and scalability** in large microservice projects.
